## Main Libraries for building the Discord Bot
+ [Discord.NET](https://discordnet.dev/index.html)  
    This API is utilizing a wrapper for commands and events that the Discord Bot API publishes.
+ [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore)
+ [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)  
    For a cleaner event handling, MediatR is used for the purpose. Multiple Handlers for the same event are supported, thanks to its implementation.
